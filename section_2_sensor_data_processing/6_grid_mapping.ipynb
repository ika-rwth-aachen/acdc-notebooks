    "In this assignment, you will get in touch with a deep learning pipeline that is used to train a model, which creates occupancy grid maps from 3D lidar point clouds. In the last exercise, you have created a geometry-based algorithm that evaluates each point in a point cloud to create an occupancy grid map. In a **deep learning-based approach**, the task is not to develop the grid mapping algorithm itself but to **create a training pipeline**. This means that the **input and label data has to be loaded and prepared** and a **neural network architecture has to be chosen** so that the neural network is able to learn how to create occupancy grid maps from 3D point clouds while trained with this data."

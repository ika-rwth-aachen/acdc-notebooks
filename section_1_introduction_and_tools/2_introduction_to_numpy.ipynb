    "Python is one of the programming languages that we will use in this MOOC. It has become very popular among data scientists and machine learning engineers, because it supports many different libraries and tools such as Jupyter Notebooks. Furthermore, the syntax is quite easy to understand, but supports full object oriented programming, as well as basic mathematical operations. NumPy is a Python library which gives Python the fundamental power for scientific computing. It adds support for more numeric data types, vectors, matrices and matrix operations. Additionally, the core of NumPy is based on well-optimized C code which enables fast and efficient computations."

The \"length\" of a vector often refers to the number of its elements. $\\text{len}(x) = n$ for the example below. Using Python and NumPy, we often denote the length along a *dimension*. Vectors are represented by 1D arrays or tuples. Each element in an array can be accessed with an index. In linear algebra, the elements of a vector are often indexed from $1$ to $n$, where $i=1$ denotes the first element $x_1$ and $n$ the last element $x_n$. In programming languages however, one usually starts counting from 0. Hence, the $0^{th}$ element $x_0$ is the first element in the array and $x_{n-1}$ is the last element.\n",

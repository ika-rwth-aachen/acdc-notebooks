    "Welcome to the Route-Planning-Assignment. In this assignment we will use the [__Lanelet2__](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2)-library to implement a generic approach to plan a route from a start-position to a desired destination. [__Lanelet2__](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2) is a C++ Library which allows the handling of map-information for automated vehicles. Furthermore the library offers support for ROS so you can use it directly in your ROS-Software stack. In this assignment we will use the python-bindings to implement a route-planning algorithm within this Jupyter-Notebook. Even if we're not directly implementing the module as ROS-Node, the learned knowledge could be applied for this purpose.\n",

This function can be applied to several layers of the lanelet-map. As already mentioned the lanelet map is composed from different primitives (e.g. `point`->`linestring`->`lanelet`). You can access the different layers of a lanelet map by typing `map.<LayerType>`. \n",

If some lanelets are found at the given position within the defined search radius, the function will return a list containing a pair `<distance, lanelet>`. The list is sorted with rising distance of the lanelet from defined position. Therefore you can access the nearest lanelet-object by typing `lanelets[0][1]`. Consider the possibility that no lanelet could be found. In this case `lanelet2.geometry.findWithin3d` will return an empty list. Thats why you should check the length of the list (e.g. `len(a_list)`) with an if-query. Moreover the function `lanelet2.geometry.findWithin3d` could return a lanelet which is not driveable by a vehicle (e.g. a walkway). Therefore you should check if the vehicle could pass the given lanelet. There to the traffic rules object offers a function `canPass(...)` which expects a lanelet object as an input. If the given lanelet can be used by the participant defined in the traffic rules, this function will return `True`. To avoid returning a lanelet which cannot be passed by the vehicle, include a check to only return the nearest lanelet, which can be utilized by the vehicle."
